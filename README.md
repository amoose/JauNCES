JauNCES
=========

Making it a joy to discover NCES data.

  - Quickly lookup a school NCES ID by searching school name or location
  - Find other available NCES data on schools

The national school identifier knows as *NCES School ID* is becoming more widely used. This API and basic front-end is designed to allow users and application developers to fetch a school's NCES data quickly and easily. This is a project created by [Garren Givens](http://www.garrengivens.com) for his work as a [Presidential Innovation Fellow](http://www.whitehouse.gov/innovationfellows).

> NCES school data is currently posted to Data.gov on an 
> annual basis. Search engines and users alike need the
> ability to find NCES data on schools quickly and easily.


## The Plan
  - Create automated Resque tasks for fetching data from ed.gov
  - Find other useful NCES data to include
  - Improve test coverage
